## Experience

### Summer Intern, CFAP Youth Council, 2021 Summer
I have worked with PCC Biology Professor Andrew Chang to create the Independent Study Course BI198 to bring health related studies to high schoolers. I invited a number of professors from Universities (like OHSU) and real doctors to lead health science PBL (Problem Based Learnings) cases. Here is the PBL cases we studied so far - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDeiCWZ8fmHDRt5Mj_nc-EGM2Y41SSIB3fakBzmEQ6c. I also handled the enrollment and registration and managed the entire class.
